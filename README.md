# CipherSquadSteganographyTool
Welcome to the Steganography Tool presented by CipherSquad

-This is an encryption app that presents the user with the ability to hide text within an image. The app has both an encode and a decode option. In the encode portion of the app, the user can upload a photo and specify what text they'd like to hide within the image. The text is then hidden in the image, and the image saved to the user's device. The user should be able to send this image to others. The receiver of the encoded image can then upload the image into the decode portion of the app, where it will process the image and reveal the hidden text.
  
The main contributors to this project have been:

  - Matthew Leja    -   
  - Jamie Christian -   Solved user interface issues presented when soft keyboard opens
                    -   Added a dialog to inform user when their image has been saved
                    -   Solve user interface issues presented when the hidden text revealed in the decode section is too long for the screen
  - Danielle Bryant -   Created the encode, decode, and main activities
                    -   Created listeners for the buttons, text view, and edit text
                    -   Gave the buttons basic functionality (launching the create activity, open a selection of apps to choose an image)
  - Jonathon Meyer  -
